<h1>Failed RDP to IP Geolocation Information</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
This project dives into cybersecurity by testing a virtual machine on Microsoft Azure. I intentionally turned off its protective firewall to see how it handles potential attacks. Using PowerShell and an IP Geolocator service, I tracked and mapped the data. I kept an eye on things with Azure Sentinel and used a special workbook to visualize the attack attempts, revealing a strong interest from someone in Poland.

- <b>Powershell</b>

<h2>Environments Used </h2>

- <b>Microsoft Azure Virtual Machine</b>
- <b>Microsoft Azure Sentinel</b>
- <b>Microsoft Azure </b>
- <b>Windows 10 </b>

Implemented a PowerShell script to relay Event Manager logs to the IP Geolocator service, generating a distinct log named 'failed_rdp.log' with geolocation parameters. This script also incorporated sample logs to facilitate Azure's algorithm training in case of delayed attacks. Linked this newly created log within Azure, establishing it as the primary data source for the map.:

Utilized a Kusto Query Language (KQL) script within Azure to extract and effectively map the data sourced from the logs for later use (Before Running Script) <br/>

Created a new workbook within Azure, serving as the foundation for the map. Employed the identical code used for data extraction as parameters for the map. Activating the map was straightforward, involving a simple adjustment in the workbook's visualization to 'map' and configuring it with the parameters recently established:

After leaving the virtual machine running for approximately 5-6 hours, this intriguing activity surfaced. It appears someone from Poland is quite determined to gain access â€“ quite the persistence!:<br/>
